I am an experienced software engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions that harness the power of Metaverse and AI. My experience spans over 7+ years of developing applications and software solutions for a wide range of businesses.

My primary focus is on developing interactive front-end applications using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vuejs, Nuxtjs, Reactjs, and Nodejs. I have extensive experience in back-end development as well, utilizing MySQL, MongoDB, AWS Beanstalk, Codeigniter, and Laravel.

Recently, I have been exploring the world of blockchain, developing projects with web3js, etherjs, threejs, Solidity, and Ethereum. I'm also exploring the possibilities of the Solana blockchain and Rust programming language.

My passion for creating software solutions extends beyond just coding. I enjoy the entire process of managing projects from conception to deployment. I'm always eager to take on new challenges, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skillset and stay ahead of the curve. My ultimate goal is to use my knowledge to create solutions that have a positive impact on the world.
